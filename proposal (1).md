# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

madness in pong

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

it's the game pong where it's two players or a computer you go against just collecting points.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

it will pretty much be similar to the original game but I'm gonna make first to five points. also, a feature that will probably ill added when u score is the word will pop up or the background flashes different colors. this will be executed in Python. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

working game, able to move the bar. Something that I hope to accomplish is for the code to mostly work minor mistake.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

more things working like the scoring system and the victory celebration. I think I can most likely have an almost fully working code some parts maybe not work how I wanted to.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

the list from before is all working and maybe more. I hope to have a fully working code with no mistakes happening. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

my next step is to look for ways to start the code. some skill I would probably have to work on is the function of be able to have controllable feathers like the bar. I will need to research how to make the automated side cpu to go against.
